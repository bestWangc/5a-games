5A Games - Where All Web3 Games Unite，One Portal to Infinite Metaverses

5A Games adopts the GameFi × DeFi operating model, aiming to break down the walls of games and create a unified infinite metaverse driven by games - in-game assets are interoperable, gameplay is interconnected, and both players and developers can benefit from a sustainable token economy.

The 5AC token is the backbone of this ecosystem. It is used for all in-game transactions, NFT casting, staking, governance, and even revenue sharing mechanisms such as group buying and liquidity mining. 5AC has a built-in deflation model, which is designed to achieve value-added over time.

We have built-in multiple official games to ensure the stable operation of the platform:

1. Mining games, buy NFT tickets, and you can mine tokens permanently
2. Staking games, staking tokens to obtain stable income
3. Casual games, free participation, earn tokens
4. Competitive games, invest tokens, the winner divides the prize pool 95% of the tokens, 5% of the tokens are destroyed, and the game is played with opponents

But 5A Games does not only want to make official games. We hope that developers can also join the ecosystem, publish their own games, and earn a share from player consumption. A one-stop solution for the future of blockchain games.

Whether you are a gamer, developer or investor, enter from 5A Games.
